# fst-emergency-minimap

This is a custom minimap script made for emergency services RP servers. It includes different map versions (Cayo Perico, Roxwood County, and bridges) with road icons for Interstates, Rural (US Routes), and Urban (State Routes). Plus, it has modern zone names for even better navigation and realism.

If you have your own ideas, I can also create a custom map just for you whether it’s adding custom colors, names, logos or anything else you have in mind!
