# Terms of Service

**Effective Date:** August 23, 2025

By purchasing or using FrostByte Studios scripts, you agree to the following terms.

### 1. License

* When you purchase a script, you receive a **license to use it** on your FiveM server.
* You do **not** own the script itself — redistribution, resale, or sharing is not allowed.
* Scripts are protected by the **CFX escrow system** to prevent unauthorized use or modification.

### 2. Usage Rules

* You may customize scripts through their configuration files, but you may not attempt to decrypt or modify encrypted files.
* You may use the script only on servers you own or manage with a valid license key.
* Sharing purchased files with others is strictly prohibited.

### 3. Refunds

* All sales are **final**. Because scripts are digital products, we do not offer refunds once a purchase is completed.
* If you experience technical issues, contact us for support — we will help resolve the problem.

### 4. Support

* Support is provided through our Discord or GitHub.
* We will make reasonable efforts to fix bugs and provide updates, but we do not guarantee compatibility with all third-party resources.

### 5. Termination

We may revoke access to scripts if you:

* Violate these Terms.
* Engage in fraud, piracy, or redistribution.

### 6. Liability

* FrostByte Studios is not responsible for issues caused by third-party resources, server instability, or misuse of our scripts.
* Our liability is limited to the value of the script you purchased.

### 7. Changes

We may update these Terms at any time. Updates will be posted in our store or documentation. Continued use of our scripts means you accept the updated terms.
